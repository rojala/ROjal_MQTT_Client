# About
ROjal_MQTT is MQTT 3.1.1 compliant client. Is support only QoS0 quality level.
It is intened to work in different type of IoT devices. Test codes and examples
uses TCP socket, but socket can be replased by any other session mechanism.

Doxygen source code documentation available [here](https://codedocs.xyz/rojala/ROjal_MQTT_Client/index.html)

The stack is outcome of JAMK IoT and Cyber security BCs thesis - [publication](https://www.theseus.fi/discover?scope=%2F&query=&submit=&filtertype_0=author&filter_relational_operator_0=equals&filter_0=Ojala%2C+Rami&rpp=10)

# API
See include/mqtt.h file or [Doxygen/CodeDocs](https://codedocs.xyz/rojala/ROjal_MQTT_Client/index.html) for details.

# How to build
## Environment and tools
Linux with cmake and gcc.

## Compiling
### Set required environment variables
* export MQTT_SERVER=123.456.789.000
* export MQTT_PORT=1883

Above variables are used with test codes only (ctest). Defining valid broker (e.g. mosquitto),
makes it possible to run unit and systemtests.

### Create build directory and compile
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make -j 4

or in single line:
* mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j 4

### Test functionality
* Run ctest in build directory
* Use rcv tool in build/bin/ directory

# FreeRTOS example
* See FreeRTOS_example/ROjal_MQTT_README.txt for more details

# Source code
Source code is located in src directory and related header files in include directory.
Include directory has mqtt_adaptation.h file, which has a few external functions which
must be changed to be suitable for target environment (Linux and FreeRTOS exists).
